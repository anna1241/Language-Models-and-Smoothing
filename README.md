# Language Models and Smoothing

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains code and implementations related to Language Models and Smoothing, particularly focusing on natural language processing tasks. The project explores various language models and introduces smoothing techniques to enhance the performance of these models.

## Key Features
- **Unigram Model:** Implementation of an unsmoothed unigram model for language processing.
- **Smoothed Unigram Model:** A unigram model enhanced with Laplace (add-one) smoothing.
- **Bigram Model:** Unsmoothed bigram model to capture dependencies between adjacent words.
- **Smoothed Bigram Model with Linear Interpolation:** Bigram model with smoothing using Linear Interpolation technique.
